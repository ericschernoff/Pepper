WHY IS THIS HERE?

This module exists to help new Perl users get started quickly.

This author believes that languages become popular when new users are able to get started quickly and become productive without a steep learning curve.  Specifically, when you can begin interacting with a database and web users within a few minutes of installing the language.  It is my goal that a new user could create a useful script with this module within 10 minutes.

This is not a framework.  It is not meant to do everything for you.  It assumes you understand HTTP interactions and can manage your own MySQL server.

Here is what this module provides:

1. Database interaction routines to connect to your database, execute SQL and retrieve results..
2. CGI routines to accept HTTP(S) requests and their parameters (GET, POST, JSON Body) plus cookies.
3. More CGI routines to send out responses as JSON, HTML, Text, or binary files, including setting cookies (if needed).

That's it.  

Oh, and this module is unabashedly geared towards the LAMP stack:  Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB and Perl.  For the Linux part, a recent version of Ubuntu or CentOS is very strongly encouraged.

This module does not provide ORM or model definition support.  SQL is extremely nice and very fast.

I love Plack, and I use Plack in my production environment.  However, CGI is a great way get started building simple web services.  Plack requires SystemD, Reverse Proxy, and URL route dispatch.  CGI requires a bit of configuration, and it just runs.
Oh, CGI requires the Perl to launch and re-interpret your code with each execute?  How is that worse than a Just-in-Time asysnchronus containerized microservice?

It is my fervent hope that new Perl developers can use this module to build some small projects, become fully addicted to Perl's flexible syntax, and ramp up to Mojolicious, Moose, AnyEvent, Template-Toolkit, and beyond.
