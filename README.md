# NAME

Pepper - Quick-start bundle for creating microservices in Perl.

# DESCRIPTION / PURPOSE

Perl is a wonderful language with an amazing ecosystem and terrific community.
This quick-start bundle is meant for new users to easily experiment and learn
about Perl and the LAMP stack, and for seasoned users to easily stand up 
simple RESTful services.

This is not a framework.  This is a quick-start bundle meant to create convenience
for learning and for small projects.  The fervent hope is that you will fall in love
with Perl and continue your journey onto Mojolicious, Dancer2, AnyEvent, PDL, Moose, Moo 
and all the other powerful Perl libraries.  

This is a LAMP stack bundle, Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, and Perl.  Of course, there are
many other fantastic options, but for the sake of simplicity, this quick-start bundle 
has made some definite choices.
